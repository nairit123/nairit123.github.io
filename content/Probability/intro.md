The goal of these notes is to develop a rigorous theory of probability using measure theory, while being accessible to undergraduate students that have already taken a proof-based math course (similar to 21-128 or 15-151 at CMU). We will use these [course notes](https://www.math.cmu.edu/users/ttkocz/teaching/1920/prob-grad-notes.pdf) for graduate probability as a basis for our notes. However, the notes assume prior knowledge of measure theory (which in turn requires real analysis), neither of which these notes will assume. That being said, these notes are probably better suited for students that have taken a real analysis course. I am personally writing these notes since graduate probability is a prerequisite for a course I want to take, and have not yet taken measure theory.
